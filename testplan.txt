In this test plan we have explained how our test cases work and their results.

--Test case 0 :For this test case we are configuring the server with client and activating the server and the output shows the project is configured

--Test case 1 :For this test case we are creating a project name test and the output signifies that creation of the project was successful.

--Test case 2 :For this test case we are adding file1 to Manifest and the output prints that file has been successfully added.

--Test case 3 :For this test case we are trying to test commit for the project and the output shows that the commits works perfectly.

--Test case 4 :For this test command push is being tested on project test and after connecting to the client and after implementation of push command 
client is successfully disconnected and file is on server. The command will fail if file does not exist.

--Test case 5 :For this test case a file named example.txt is being added to the manifest from the client side.
